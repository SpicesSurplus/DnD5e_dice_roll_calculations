# What is this?
This repository features calculations from the PHB that use dnd dice

So far, I'm using d6s for the code provided but I would like to add an input so you can make your own d8s, d10s, and others. 

It's not much but it's honest work


# What features are coming next?
- Armor class calculation????



# What does each file do?

die_maker.py (creates one die to be used)

roll_ability_scores.py (rolls all six ability scores and modifiers)
